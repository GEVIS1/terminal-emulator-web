# terminal-emulator-web
A toy terminal emulator written in Typescript using Vite and Bun

An experiment in using HTML elements as a dynamic "canvas", rather than the HTML Canvas tag.

Currently supported commands are hostname, whoami, help and clear.
Any input you give it and execute is echoed above in the screen buffer.

Client side only. Stores no data from sessions, but adding text and/or file editing to be stored in session storage is on the roadmap.
